    "An ordinal relationship is introduced when we assign numbers to letters based on their alphabetical order that doesn’t actually exist between letters. For instance, the difference between b and c is treated as the same as the difference between a and b, which may imply some kind of linear relationship. Further, the distance between a (1) and z (26) is far greater than the distance between a (1) and b (2). This implies that a and z are very different, which might not always be true in the context of word prediction. In addition a loss of Contextual and positional information is also possible.\n",

    "An Embedding Layer is a part of machine learning models that allows the processing and reduction of high-dimensional categorical data into a lower-dimensional space. The purpose of an embedding layer is to transform categorical data (like letters or words) into dense vectors in a continuous vector space, where relationships between the data can be learned and represented in a meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "An embedding layer takes sparse inputs (like numbers representing letters) and converts them into dense, low-dimensional vectors. For example, instead of representing \"a\" as 1, \"b\" as 2, etc., the embedding layer will learn to represent each letter or word as a vector of numbers, such as [0.1, 0.2, -0.3] for one letter. During training, the embedding layer adjusts these vector representations so that similar entities are closer together in this learned space. Unlike raw numerical encoding, embedding layers do not impose any ordinal structure on the data. The embedding vectors are learned from data in a way that captures patterns and relationships without assuming an inherent numerical order.\n",
